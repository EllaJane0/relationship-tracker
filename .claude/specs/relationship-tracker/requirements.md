# Requirements Document

## Introduction
The Relationship Tracker is a React Native Expo application designed to help users maintain meaningful relationships by tracking communication history with friends and family. The app will remind users when it's time to reach out to contacts they haven't spoken with recently. This initial version focuses on establishing the foundational structure with contact management, basic data persistence, and a clean iOS-optimized interface.

## Requirements

### 1. Project Setup and Configuration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured Expo React Native project with TypeScript, so that I can build a type-safe, maintainable cross-platform application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN it SHALL use Expo SDK with TypeScript configuration
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the project SHALL include React Navigation, expo-contacts, expo-sqlite, and necessary type definitions
3. WHEN the app runs THEN it SHALL be optimized for iOS deployment with appropriate configuration in app.json
4. IF the developer runs the project THEN it SHALL compile without TypeScript errors

### 2. Navigation Structure
**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between different sections of the app, so that I can access contacts, view home dashboard, and adjust settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the app launches THEN it SHALL display a bottom tab navigation with three tabs: Home, Contacts, and Settings
2. WHEN a user taps a navigation tab THEN the app SHALL navigate to the corresponding screen
3. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the app SHALL maintain consistent navigation UI with iOS-styled icons
4. IF a screen is active THEN its corresponding tab SHALL be visually highlighted

### 3. Contact Permissions and Integration
**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to access my phone contacts, so that I can track communication with people I already know.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the app needs contact access THEN it SHALL request permission from the user with clear messaging
2. IF permission is granted THEN the app SHALL retrieve all contacts from the device
3. IF permission is denied THEN the app SHALL display a user-friendly error message explaining why access is needed
4. WHEN permission status changes THEN the app SHALL handle the state change gracefully without crashing
5. IF an error occurs during contact retrieval THEN the app SHALL display an appropriate error message

### 4. Contact List Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a list of my contacts with their information, so that I can view who I need to stay in touch with.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN contacts are loaded THEN the app SHALL display them in a scrollable list on the Contacts screen
2. WHEN displaying a contact THEN it SHALL show the contact's name and phone number
3. WHEN displaying a contact THEN it SHALL show a placeholder field for "last contacted" date
4. IF a contact has no phone number THEN it SHALL still display the contact with appropriate handling
5. WHEN the contact list is empty THEN the app SHALL display a message indicating no contacts are available
6. IF contacts are loading THEN the app SHALL display a loading indicator

### 5. Database Setup for Interaction Tracking
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a SQLite database configured, so that interaction data can be persisted locally on the device.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the app initializes THEN it SHALL create or open a SQLite database
2. WHEN the database is created THEN it SHALL include a table for storing contact interaction records
3. WHEN storing interaction data THEN the table SHALL include fields for contact ID, last contacted date, and timestamps
4. IF database operations fail THEN the app SHALL handle errors gracefully with appropriate logging
5. WHEN the app restarts THEN it SHALL persist previously stored interaction data

### 6. User Interface and Styling
**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive interface, so that the app is pleasant and easy to use on my iPhone.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN viewing any screen THEN it SHALL use consistent iOS-optimized styling
2. WHEN viewing the app THEN it SHALL use readable fonts, appropriate spacing, and clear visual hierarchy
3. WHEN interacting with UI elements THEN they SHALL provide visual feedback (e.g., touch highlighting)
4. IF the device has a notch THEN the app SHALL handle safe areas appropriately
5. WHEN viewing lists THEN they SHALL be easily scrollable with smooth performance

### 7. Code Quality and Documentation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-structured, documented code, so that the project is maintainable and beginner-friendly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN reviewing components THEN they SHALL be functional components using React hooks
2. WHEN reviewing code THEN all functions and components SHALL have TypeScript type definitions
3. WHEN reading code THEN critical sections SHALL include clear comments explaining functionality
4. IF a component handles errors THEN it SHALL include appropriate error handling logic
5. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN files SHALL be organized logically by feature/concern

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases
1. Contact has multiple phone numbers - display the first available
2. Contact has no name - display "Unknown Contact"
3. Database initialization fails - app should still run but notify user of limited functionality
4. User revokes permissions after granting - handle gracefully with re-request option
5. Empty contact list - provide helpful message to user

### Constraints
1. Must use Expo managed workflow (no bare React Native)
2. TypeScript must be used throughout
3. iOS optimization is priority (Android compatibility secondary)
4. Must work offline (local SQLite storage)
5. Beginner-friendly code with clear comments
6. All dependencies must be Expo-compatible
